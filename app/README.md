This project is created by Tsvetelina Peycheva(F95243) and Iliyana Balabanova(F102156).

Our project gets a daily horoscope for each zodiac sign and has a registration form 
that saves users to the database. Also, we have implemented a background service that 
plays music while the app is running.

We get the horoscopes by sending asynchronous POST requests to an astrological API.
The token for the API is located in the secrets folder(we have it exposed so it would  
be easier for you to test).
